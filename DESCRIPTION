Description: Inference of ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions from single-cell
    expression (transcriptomics/proteomics) data.
    SingleCellSignalR v2 inferences rely on the statistical model we
    introduced in the BulkSignalR package as well as the original
    SingleCellSignalR LR-score (both are available).
    SingleCellSignalR v2 can be regarded as a wrapper
    to BulkSignalR fundamental classes. This also enables v2 users to work with
    any species, whereas only Mus musculus & Homo sapiens were available before
    in SingleCellSignalR v1.
